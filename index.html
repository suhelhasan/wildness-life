          <h2>Fox..</h2>
          <p>
            Foxes are mammalian and omnivorous animals belonging to the Canidae
            family. They are medium-sized vulpids, characterized by a long snout
            and a long, hairy tail.
          </p>
          <p>
            They also have their oval pupils, which are similar to the felids'
            vertical pupils.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of about 40 species recognized as foxes, only 12 belong to the
            Vulpes genus of "true foxes", of which the red fox is the most
            common.
